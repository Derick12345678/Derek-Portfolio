      <li>Volleyball</li>
        <p>
          For the last few years, I’ve been drawn to volleyball for its fast-pace and strategy. The game always keeps me on my 
          toes, and I enjoy the quick decision-making that is needed in the sport. Playing volleyball has helped me develop 
          resilience and communication skills, as well as a strong commitment to my team. Whether it be indoors or beach, I’m 
          always more than happy to be playing!

      <li>Fishing</li>
        <p>
          Ever since my friend asked me to go fishing with him, fishing has become an enjoyable pastime for me. It seems so 
          boring yet offers a mix of patience, skill, and relaxation. I enjoy the anticipation of each catch. Being outdoors is 
          refreshing, and every fishing experience feels rewarding, whether it’s catching something or simply enjoying the 
          sunrise.
